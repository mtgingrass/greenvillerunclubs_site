                <p>
                    The past few days in Greenville have been a runner's dream. After weeks of unseasonably warm weather, the temperature finally dropped, bringing that crisp air that makes you want to lace up and hit the pavement.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Monday's run along the Swamp Rabbit Trail felt different. The usual struggle against humidity was gone, replaced by easy breathing and that perfect chill that starts cold but warms up just right after the first mile. My usual 5-mile route felt easier, and I found myself adding an extra loop at Cleveland Park just because it felt so good.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cooler mornings have brought out more runners than usual. Tuesday's 6 AM group had nearly double the typical attendance. There's something about 45-degree weather that turns fair-weather joggers into dedicated runners. The parking lot at Falls Park was packed by 6:15, and the energy was contagious.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Wednesday brought fog along the Reedy River, creating an almost mystical running experience. Visibility was limited, but the muffled sounds and cool mist made for one of those runs you remember. The usual landmarks disappeared and reappeared like scenes from a movie. Several runners mentioned it was their favorite run of the year so far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The temperature drop has also changed the post-run dynamics. Instead of immediately seeking air conditioning and cold drinks, groups are lingering longer, enjoying hot coffee at Methodical or The Commons. Conversations flow easier when you're not dripping sweat and desperate for shade.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thursday evening's run with the Track Club showcased another benefit of cooler weather: faster times. The group knocked out 800-meter repeats with noticeably less struggle. PRs were common, and the usual groans between intervals were replaced with actual conversation. Coach mentioned that this is the weather we train for all summer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Saturday's long run proved the point. Starting from the YMCA, our group of eight maintained a steady pace through downtown, up through North Main, and back via the trail. What would typically be a sufferfest in summer humidity turned into one of those runs where everything clicks. Miles passed quickly, conversation never lagged, and nobody needed to stop for extra water breaks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These cooler days won't last forever in South Carolina. Soon enough, we'll be back to 5 AM starts to beat the heat and carrying water bottles for 3-mile runs. But for now, Greenville running is at its best. The trails are busy, the groups are energized, and every run feels like a celebration of why we love this sport.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you've been thinking about joining a running group or getting back into a routine, now is the time. The weather is perfect, the community is welcoming, and the miles are there for the taking. See you out on the trails.
