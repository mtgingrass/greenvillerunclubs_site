                <p>
                    After logging thousands of miles across Greenville's streets, trails, and greenways over the past fifteen years, I've discovered routes that showcase why our city has become a runner's paradise. From the iconic Swamp Rabbit Trail to hidden neighborhood gems, Greenville offers diverse terrain and scenery that keeps every run interesting. Whether you're visiting for the Spinx Run Fest or you're a longtime resident seeking new paths, this guide covers the routes that define running in the Upstate.
                </p>

                <h2>The Swamp Rabbit Trail: Greenville's Crown Jewel</h2>

                <p>
                    No discussion of Greenville running starts without the Swamp Rabbit Trail. This 28-mile greenway has transformed how we run, commute, and connect as a community. But with so many access points and sections, knowing where to run can be overwhelming for newcomers.
                </p>

                <div class="route-info">
                    <h4>Downtown to Travelers Rest (Full Northern Section)</h4>
                    <div class="route-stats">
                        <div class="route-stat">
                            <strong>Distance:</strong>
                            <span>11 miles one-way</span>
                        </div>

                        <div class="route-stat">

                        </div>
                        <div class="route-stat">
                            <strong>Best Parking:</strong>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Starting from Linky Stone Park near downtown, this section heads north through Greenville's evolving neighborhoods. The first few miles wind through residential areas before opening up near Furman University. The trail parallels the Reedy River, offering shade and water fountains at regular intervals. The gradual uphill grade heading north makes for a fast return trip‚Äîperfect for progression runs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Key landmarks include the Swamp Rabbit Cafe at mile 3 (excellent mid-run fuel stop), Furman University at mile 5, and the charming downtown Travelers Rest at mile 11. Many runners use TR as a turnaround point, making this a popular 22-mile long run route.
                </p>

                <div class="route-info">
                    <h4>Falls Park Loop</h4>

                </div>

                <p>
                    For a shorter run with maximum scenic impact, the Falls Park loop delivers. Start at Main Street's western end, descend to Falls Park, cross the Liberty Bridge for the photo opportunity, then follow the trail south to Cleveland Park. Return via the opposite bank for constantly changing views. Early morning runs here, when mist rises from the falls, are magical.
                </p>

                <h2>Paris Mountain State Park: Trail Running Heaven</h2>

                <p>
                    Just 15 minutes from downtown, Paris Mountain State Park offers legitimate trail running that rivals anything in the Southeast. The park's 15 miles of trails range from gentle lakeside paths to challenging mountain ascents.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Perfect for trail running beginners, this loop circles the park's lower lake with minimal elevation change. The packed dirt trail offers excellent footing in most conditions, though it can get muddy after rain. Wildlife sightings are common, particularly deer in early morning hours.

This route serves as excellent training for mountain races.

                    When you need hill work without driving to Paris Mountain, these adjacent neighborhoods deliver. The loop around Alta Vista and through Botany Woods features sustained climbs and quad-burning descents. Local runners use Richland Way's hill for repeats‚Äîit's steep enough to build strength but short enough to maintain form.
                </p>

                <h2>Long Run Routes: Going the Distance</h2>

                <h3>The Greenville Marathon Route</h3>

                <p>
                    Understanding the Spinx Run Fest marathon course provides an excellent 26.2-mile tour of Greenville. Starting downtown, the route heads north on the Swamp Rabbit Trail to Furman, loops through residential neighborhoods, returns downtown via different streets, then ventures south before finishing on Main Street. Running sections of this course prepares you for race day while exploring diverse areas.
                </p>

                <h3>Prisma Health Campus Loops</h3>

                <p>
                    The roads surrounding Prisma Health's Patewood campus offer safe, well-lit options for early morning or evening runs. The 2.5-mile perimeter loop features rolling hills and wide shoulders. Multiple loops here have sustained countless marathon training cycles for local runners who need predictable, safe routes during dark hours.
                </p>

                <h2>Seasonal Considerations</h2>

                <h3>Summer Strategy (June-September)</h3>

                <p>
                    Greenville's summer humidity demands route adjustments. Prioritize shaded paths like the tree-covered sections of the Swamp Rabbit Trail north of Furman. Start runs before 7 AM or after 7 PM to avoid peak heat. The Reedy River sections provide psychological cooling even when temperatures soar.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For long runs, create loops that pass water fountains every 2-3 miles. The McDaniel Avenue to Falls Park to Cleveland Park circuit hits three fountains in 4 miles. Consider stashing water bottles along your route the night before‚Äîa common practice among local marathoners.
                </p>

                <h3>Winter Routes (December-February)</h3>

                <p>
                    Greenville's mild winters rarely require significant route changes, but occasional ice demands caution. The Swamp Rabbit Trail gets priority clearing and salting, making it the safest option after winter weather. Paris Mountain trails drain well but can be slippery when temperatures hover near freezing.
                </p>

                <h2>Safety Tips for Greenville Routes</h2>

                <p>
                    While Greenville ranks among the safest cities for runners, smart practices ensure positive experiences:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Swamp Rabbit Trail sees heavy use on weekends. Run against traffic flow (on the left) for better visibility</li>
                    <li>Downtown routes require extra attention during event weekends when visitors unfamiliar with running culture crowd sidewalks</li>
                    <li>Paris Mountain trails close at dusk. Plan accordingly and carry a headlamp for unexpected delays</li>
                    <li>Summer afternoon thunderstorms develop quickly. Monitor weather and have bail-out points planned</li>
                    <li>Carry identification and phone, especially when running alone on trails</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Hidden Gems and Insider Tips</h2>

                <p>
                    After years of exploring, certain routes stand out for specific purposes:
                </p>

                <h3>Speed Work: Greenville High School Track</h3>
                <p>
                    Open to public when school isn't in session, this track hosts Greenville Track Club workouts Wednesday evenings. The surface received updates in 2023, providing excellent footing for interval training.
                </p>

                <h3>Hill Repeats: Altamont Road</h3>
                <p>
                    This quiet residential street near Paris Mountain offers a 0.4-mile climb perfect for hill repeats. The steady grade and minimal traffic create ideal conditions for building strength.
                </p>

                <h3>Recovery Runs: Conestee Park</h3>
                <p>
                    South of downtown, Conestee Nature Preserve provides flat, soft trails ideal for easy days. The 3-mile loop around Lake Conestee rarely gets crowded, offering peaceful running when you need mental recovery too.
                </p>

                <h2>Connecting Routes: Creating Your Perfect Run</h2>

                <p>
                    Greenville's interconnected trail system allows creative route building. Some favorite combinations:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The Grand Tour (15 miles):</strong> Start at Falls Park, head north on Swamp Rabbit Trail to Furman, cut through campus to Roe Ford Road, follow it to Paris Mountain State Park entrance, return via Altamont Road to State Park Road, rejoin Swamp Rabbit Trail southbound.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The Neighborhood Explorer (10 miles):</strong> Begin downtown, run through North Main Historic District, continue to Overbrook, loop through Alta Vista, descend to McDaniel Avenue, follow it to Swamp Rabbit Trail, return downtown via the trail.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>The Park Hopper (8 miles):</strong> Start at Cleveland Park, follow Swamp Rabbit to downtown, loop Falls Park, continue to Unity Park, explore its trails, return via Hudson Street to rejoin Swamp Rabbit northbound.
                </p>

                <h2>Route Etiquette and Local Culture</h2>

                <p>
                    Understanding Greenville's running culture enhances your experience. Wave or nod to passing runners‚Äîit's expected and appreciated. Yield to uphill runners on narrow trail sections. Thank cyclists who announce their passing on the Swamp Rabbit Trail.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Local runners have established certain traditions: Thursday morning groups often grab coffee at Methodical after runs, Saturday long runs from Fleet Feet traditionally end with socializing in their parking lot, and Tuesday evening track sessions welcome newcomers wanting to test their speed.
                </p>

                <h2>Planning Your Routes</h2>

                <p>
                    Successful route planning in Greenville considers several factors:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Parking availability varies by time and day. Falls Park lots fill by 9 AM on weekends</li>
                    <li>Restaurant districts get congested during meal times‚Äîavoid Main Street during lunch unless you enjoy dodging diners</li>
                    <li>School zones create traffic during academic year. Plan routes accordingly</li>
                    <li>Event schedules affect accessibility. Check Greenville's event calendar before planning downtown routes</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Final Thoughts: Your Greenville Running Journey</h2>

                <p>
                    These routes represent just the beginning of what Greenville offers runners. Each season brings new discoveries‚Äîa neighborhood connection you hadn't noticed, a trail variation that adds perfect mileage, or a view that stops you mid-stride despite passing it hundreds of times.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The beauty of running in Greenville lies not just in our infrastructure but in how these routes connect us as a community. Whether you're chasing PRs on the Swamp Rabbit Trail, building strength on Paris Mountain's slopes, or enjoying easy miles through historic neighborhoods, you're part of a running culture that makes Greenville special.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Get out there and explore. Start with these routes, then branch out. Talk to other runners, join group runs, and discover your own favorite paths. The best route is the one that gets you out the door consistently, and in Greenville, you'll never lack options to keep your running fresh and inspiring.
